CakePHP 2.5.2 With Basic ACL integrated
=======


[![CakePHP](http://cakephp.org/img/cake-logo.png)](http://www.cakephp.org)

CakePHP is a rapid development framework for PHP which uses commonly known design patterns like Active Record, Association Data Mapping, Front Controller and MVC.
Our primary goal is to provide a structured framework that enables PHP users at all levels to rapidly develop robust web applications, without any loss to flexibility.

This project can be used as a starting point of your project. 

I will be adding tutorials on how to use this soon.
